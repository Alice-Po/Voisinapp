# Frontend

This is the frontend application for Mastopod, built with React and Vite.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Yarn

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:4004.

## Testing

### Running Tests

The project uses Cucumber.js for end-to-end testing. Tests are located in the `features` directory.

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test-features

# Run specific tests using tags
yarn test-features --tags "@tag_name"
```

### Common Test Tags
- `@post_note_with_photo`: Tests posting a note with a photo

### Test Files Structure
- `features/*.feature`: Feature files containing test scenarios
- `features/step_definitions/*.js`: Step definitions implementing the test scenarios

### Known Issues

#### Puppeteer and GNOME Integration

When running tests, you might encounter issues with Puppeteer on GNOME systems. There are two possible solutions:

1. **Recommended**: Modify GNOME settings
   ```bash
   sudo nano org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.xsettings.gschema.xml
   ```
   This solution was found in [espanso/espanso#1122](https://github.com/espanso/espanso/issues/1122)

2. **Alternative**: Configure Puppeteer to run without GPU
   ```javascript
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
     headless: true,
     args: [
       '--no-sandbox',
       '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
       '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
       '--disable-gpu',
       '--disable-software-rasterizer',
     ],
   });
   ```
   Note: This solution disables browser GUI testing.

## Development Guidelines

- Avoid using arrow functions with React hooks
- Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations
