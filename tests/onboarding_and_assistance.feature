  As a new user
  I want to be guided through the application
  In order to understand how it works

  Scenario: First launch
    Given I launch the application for the first time
    When I complete the initial setup
    Then I see an interactive tutorial
    And I can follow it step by step
    And I can skip it

  Scenario: Contextual help
    Given I am on a page
    When I click on help
    Then I see an explanation of the features
