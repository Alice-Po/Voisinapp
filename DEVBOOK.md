# VoisinApp Development Guide

## Development Approach

### 1. Understanding ActivityPods First

Before starting development:
1. Familiarize yourself with ActivityPods concepts
2. Set up a local development environment
3. Understand how data is stored and shared between PODs
4. Learn about ActivityPub protocol basics

### 2. Feature Development Process

For each feature:

1. **Write Feature Tests First**
   ```gherkin
   Feature: Geographic Note Sharing
   Scenario: Share note with geographic scope
     Given I am logged in
     When I create a note
     Then I can set its geographic scope
   ```

2. **Implement Step Definitions**
   - Write clear, reusable steps
   - Use page objects for better maintenance
   - Keep tests independent

3. **Develop the Feature**
   - Start with the data model
   - Implement the UI components
   - Add backend integration
   - Test thoroughly

4. **Review and Refine**
   - Check test coverage
   - Review performance
   - Ensure proper error handling

### 3. Geographic Features Implementation

1. **Start Simple**
   - Begin with basic location selection
   - Add radius selection later
   - Gradually add more complex features

2. **Add Complexity Gradually**
   - Multiple address support
   - Dynamic radius adjustment
   - Location-based filtering

### 4. Tag System Development

1. **Basic Implementation**
   - Simple tag creation
   - Tag selection interface
   - Basic tag search

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Tag suggestions
   - Popular tags
   - Tag combinations

### 5. Testing Strategy

1. **Write Tests First**
   - Feature files for behavior
   - Unit tests for complex logic
   - Integration tests for API

2. **Test Categories**
   - User interactions
   - Geographic features
   - Data persistence
   - Error cases

### 6. UI/UX Development

1. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with basic functionality
   - Add advanced features later
   - Keep the interface simple

2. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - Design for mobile first
   - Add desktop enhancements
   - Test on multiple devices

## Development Tips

### 1. Getting Started
- Set up the development environment first
- Start with a simple feature
- Build incrementally
- Test frequently

### 2. Common Challenges
- Geographic calculations complexity
- Real-time updates
- Data synchronization
- Mobile responsiveness

### 3. Best Practices
- Keep features focused
- Write clear tests
- Document as you go
- Regular code reviews

## Development Workflow

1. **Start with Features**
   - Write feature files
   - Implement step definitions
   - Create page objects

2. **Component Development**
   - Create basic components
   - Add functionality
   - Style components
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Integration**
   - Connect to ActivityPods
   - Test data flow
   - Handle errors
   - Add real-time updates

4. **Refinement**
   - Optimize performance
   - Improve UX
   - Add animations
   - Polish design

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with core features
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Test thoroughly

2. **Focus on User Experience**
   - Keep it simple
   - Make it intuitive
   - Test with real users

3. **Maintain Quality**
   - Regular testing
   - Code reviews
   - Documentation
   - Performance monitoring
